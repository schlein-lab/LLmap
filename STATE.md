# LLmap Autonomous Build State

This file is the source of truth for autonomous-driver continuation. The driver script reads `current_task` to decide what to do next, and writes back progress + next task after each iteration.

- [x] **Phase 0: Foundations** — CMake, AlignmentRecord, BucketPyramid, synthetic data
  - [x] Phase 0.1: AlignmentRecord type + tests (8 tests pass)
  - [x] Phase 0.2: BucketPyramid data structure + serialization (11 tests pass)
  - [x] Phase 0.3: WaveState sparse CSR + GPU stub (21 tests pass)
  - [x] Phase 0.4: Synthetic IGH-locus generator + simulator wrappers (56 tests pass)
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation Model Integration
- [ ] Phase 2: Stage 1 Self-Interference

## Current task

```
phase: 1
task: foundation_model_integration
substep: 3/3
last_action: created test ONNX model generator + verified FoundationEmbedder with real ONNX Runtime inference; 10 new tests (85 total pass)
next_action: implement Evo-1.5B bucket embedder or wire real Caduceus-Ph model download; add benchmark for embedder throughput
acceptance: bucket embedding pipeline ready; throughput benchmarked on representative sequences
```

## How the autonomous driver reads this file

The driver script `scripts/autonomous_driver.sh` runs every 15 min via cron. Each invocation:

1. Pings Hummel — if down, sends Zyrkel alert and exits cleanly (will retry next cycle)
2. `cd ~/llmap-local && git pull origin main`
3. Reads `STATE.md` → extracts `current_task` block
4. Spawns `claude -p "$(cat scripts/continuation_prompt.md)"` — Claude CLI subprocess with full context
5. Claude continues the work: writes code, builds, tests, commits, pushes
6. Driver verifies Claude updated `STATE.md` with progress
7. Logs to `autonomous_run.log` and `driver invocations log` table above

If Claude fails to advance for 3 consecutive iterations, driver pages via Zyrkel.
